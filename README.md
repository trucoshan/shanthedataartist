## Restaurant Analytics (Level 1 and 2) [Cognifyz Internship]
 
Task – Restaurant Data Analysis & Business Intelligence  

For this task, I analyzed a global restaurant dataset to uncover cuisine trends, customer preferences, and chain performance. Using Python (Pandas for wrangling, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Folium/Plotly for mapping), I turned raw data into actionable business insights.  

🔹 Steps Taken  

• Data Wrangling: Cleaned and structured dataset with data dictionary and handling of chains.  
• Feature Engineering: Created **Weighted Rating Numerators** and applied **Bayesian Weighted Rating logic** to filter out small-sample bias.  
• Cuisine Analysis: Identified most **common** and **popular** cuisine combinations by frequency and demand.  
• Chain Analysis: Evaluated 734 restaurant chains across rating tiers (top-rated, average, low-rated).  
• Geographic Mapping: Visualized restaurant density and hotspots across countries using interactive maps.  
• BI Framing: Converted statistical insights into business intelligence recommendations (expansion, pricing, delivery strategy, and brand benchmarking).  

📊 Key Insights Identified  

✔ Most ratings fall between **3.5–4.5**, with ~202 votes on average — social proof drives trust.  
✔ **North Indian + Chinese** is the most frequent combo, while **Fast Food + Healthy/American** combos dominate popularity.  
✔ Premium cuisines (Sushi, Burgers, Continental-Italian) consistently achieve weighted ratings ≥4.  
✔ Big QSR chains (McDonald’s, Subway, KFC) cluster in the “average-rated” range despite high reach.  
✔ **Barbeque Nation** and **Absolute Barbecues** emerge as high-rated, high-volume leaders.  
✔ Domino’s shows strong reach but low satisfaction (avg. rating 3.4) → brand risk.  

🔑 Takeaways  

• Expansion → Focus on Delhi NCR & Indian metros; test suburban growth in US East Coast.  
• Cuisine Mix → Strengthen Indo-Chinese, Mughlai, Fast Food; scale premium Sushi/Continental niches.  
• Pricing → Stay affordable (Price Range 1 & 2 dominate).  
• Delivery → Huge opportunity but fix **quality gaps** (packaging, timeliness).  
• Chains → QSR giants need menu/service innovation; premium chains should **scale aggressively**.  

✨ Learning Outcome  

• Enhanced my ability to apply **Bayesian weighted logic** in real-world datasets.  
• Learned to combine statistical rigor with **business intelligence framing**.  
• Gained insights into how data analytics can guide **menu design, expansion strategy, and customer experience**.
